# Clean Navigation in Flutter Using Generated Routes

This tutorial will cover setting up a Router in Flutter to make navigation calls cleaner and less verbose.

## Introduction

Navigation in Flutter can be done in one of two ways: Named routes, or pushing Routes explicitly by instantiating a PageRoute and passing it to the Navigator. Pushing routes can become quite explicit and sharing logic between them becomes difficult. Logic like checking if the user is authenticated for a specific view. In this post we'll setup a Router for Flutter and allow you to use named routes with parameters.
